# Friday Tech Projects  

## Intro  
On Fridays, we learn! Friday Projects are meant to promote the learning of new technologies/libraries. ~~The expectation bar is set low~~ so don't worry too much about what you decide to do,
just make sure it's interesting to you on some level. It doesn't need to be directly related to work and there aren't really any rules other than it needs to be related to programming.
