# Friday Tech Projects  

## Intro  
On Fridays, we learn! Friday Projects are meant to promote the learning of new technologies/libraries. ~~The expectation bar is set low~~ so don't worry too much about what you decide to do,
just make sure it's interesting to you on some level. It doesn't need to be directly related to work and there aren't really any rules other than it needs to be related to programming.  

## How To  
9. Make a fork of this repo
9. Create a directory for the Friday Date you are presenting (format : `YYYY-MM-DD`)
9. Then go wild, use this directory for any relevant files for your project.
	* Helpful Things to Include ~~Guide Lines~~ 
		9. `README.md` : just to give a little background. Think WhatWhyWhatWho
			* **What** : What is your topic?
			* **Why** : Why is your topic interesting to you?
			* **What** : What did you learn about your topic from this project (*if anything*)
			* **Who** : Give some credit back. Lets not get carried away here. No need of MLA formatted citations. Just some simple links with a short descriptive sentence next to it.
		9. `Sources.md` (optional but preferred) : Just put the `Who` from `README.md` in a separate file to keep things neat.
		9. What ever the hell you want : this is your chance to Do You! Make a full blown app or just add some markdown pages with your comments, opinions, thoughts on a subject.
9. Make a pull request before your presentation time.
9. Reserve a room/time for your presentation
9. Make some sort of visual presentation to share (i.e. demo your project, google slide show to summarize it, make a video, ~~bring in a speaker~~)
9. Lastly but pretty importantly... DON'T PLAGIARIZE OR infringe on copyrights. This isn't high school and no one's benefiting from this if you just clone a repo and merge it in here as your project.
Feel free to go step by step through a demo/tutorial (kind of copying but its meant for that). And for copyrights...lawyers are a pain and we don't need that kinda drama in here.
