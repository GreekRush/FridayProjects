INSTRUCTIONS - TECH TALK 

Make a fork of this repo
Create a directory for the Friday Date you are presenting (format : YYYY-MM-DD)
Then go wild, use this directory for any relevant files for your project.
Helpful Things to Include Guide Lines
README.md : just to give a little background. Think WhatWhyWhatWho
What : What is your topic?
Why : Why is your topic interesting to you?
What : What did you learn about your topic from this project (if anything)
Who : Give some credit back. Lets not get carried away here. No need of MLA formatted citations. Just some simple links with a short descriptive sentence next to it.
Sources.md (optional but preferred) : Just put the Who from README.md in a separate file to keep things neat.
What ever the hell you want : this is your chance to Do You! Make a full blown app or just add some markdown pages with your comments, opinions, thoughts on a subject.
Make some sort of visual presentation to share (i.e. demo your project, google slide show to summarize it, make a video, bring in a speaker)
Lastly but pretty importantly... DON'T PLAGIARIZE OR infringe on copyrights. This isn't high school and no one's benefiting from this if you just clone a repo and merge it in here as your project. Feel free to go step by step through a demo/tutorial (kind of copying but its meant for that). And for copyrights...lawyers are a pain and we don't need that kinda drama in here.
